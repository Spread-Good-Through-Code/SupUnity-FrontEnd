ETH And Solidity Learning Notes 
---

Account - 
Account Address - Unique Identifier , like a username 
Public Key -  Password of sorts, used to authorizing transactions 
Private Key -

Private and Public Key are all hexidecimel  - base 10 number if input into javascript 


On account can be used on all  networks . Main Ropsten Kovan Rinkeby 

A Transaction  - A record, one account attempting to send money to another account 

Trasaction object properties - 
nonce - How many times the sender (original sender) has sent a transaction. nonsense? 
to - address of account this money is going to 
value  - amount of ether to send to the target address 
gasPrice - Amount of ther the sender is willing to pay per gas unit to get this transaction processed 
startGas / GasLimit - Units of gas that this transaction can consume  
vrs - complex pieces of data. Crytographic pieces of data that can be used to generate the senders account. Genereted from the senders private key. If you have the private key, you can generate the vrs. You cant backwards get the private key from the vrs 



Nodes - 
Get transactions (can be multiple at a time, called a BLOCK) 
Node runs validation logic, this takes long time 
Mining - validating transactions 


Blockchain Demo notes - 
Money movements that can be verified by each node (computer in the network) 

Each money transfer or "block" gets hashed in a specific way that makes it unique, each node then gets a copy 

While its possible for this to be "hacked" , "changed" or "remined" its very difficult to do due to each node in the network having a copy of the ledger, money movements. 

Account balance is calculated based on all previous blocks to verify if funds are available
