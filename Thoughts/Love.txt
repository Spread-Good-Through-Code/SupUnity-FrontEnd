LOVE 

---

What does it mean to spread LOVE 

---

To think about another before yourself when making a CHOICE 

What else 

Taking an action or thought towards another that spreads TRUE, FAITH, CREATIVITY, FUN 

What stops me from spreading more LOVE 

Willingess? Laizness? With unlimited energy that is sad - the body has its limits , yet how often have I reached it - if every day is its last wouldnt I use all of my energy, deplete all of my storage  

Food is energy and energy is abundent, humans are at the top of the food chain, disgustingly so , through machines and automated farming and killing. 

We should be at the top of spreading love, yet we hate - we envy - we compare  - we are lazy .

Love takes sacarafice, an exchange of your energy for something you wont have pleasure out of. Yet spreading love is pleasurable, if I so choose. 

In love, to feel anothers love.
