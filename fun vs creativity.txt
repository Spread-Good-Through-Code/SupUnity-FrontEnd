fun vs creativity 

fun - your mind can trick you into thinking you're having fun
everyone has fun in different ways. everywhere. 

are you GOOD when you're drunk ?
being drunk short circuits your decesion making abilities, but the choices we make while drunk can still be TRUE, spread FAITH, LOVE , FUN and CREATIVITY. But they can very easily cause HARM even if unentional, GOD would know the truth. 

GOOD decesion making even while sober is already difficult, getting drunk is OK IMO, however there is a HIGH RISK that if you are not disicplined enough you will act agaisnt yourself / other pieces of GOD.

As a matter a fact, I belive most get drunk to reach GOD, FAITH, LOVE, FUN and CREATIVITY, with friends or alone.  

- bad for your body , but your body is yours. 


creativity - the quality or ability to create or invent something 


-- 

is doing what you want inherntly evil? 

-- no , if youre following your instincts and not causing harm to GOD.
