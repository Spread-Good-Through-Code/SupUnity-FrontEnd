Similar to a ring doorbell alert, members could get an alert on their phone and review the help form that was submitted. Members could decide to use the invested community funds to help said member. Members could decide to impose additional requirements as well as check ins or re-payment requirements after a grace period if so desired. These requirements and the contract between the community could be backed by smart contracts. Voting and consensus would be completed in a public blockchain until both parties come to agreement on the terms. Once both the person in distress and the community agree to terms, the funds would be released to said user or allocated by the terms in the contract.
