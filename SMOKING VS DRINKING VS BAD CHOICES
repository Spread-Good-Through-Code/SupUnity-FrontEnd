OPINION

----

May we think of freedom not as the right to do as we please , but as as the oppourtunity / CHOICE to do what is right. 

Your body is the vechile to exert your will. Be kind to it to exert your will longer, but it is YOURS. Choices are what make life. 

is making bad choices inherently BAD 

What defines a bad choice - 

1. One may think what someone else is doing is a bad choice, your opinion or JUDGEMENT on another. Does that make it BAD, simply because your proclaim it? To judge another is inherntly evil, to make an assumption, to spread hate. Withen yourself due to the imagined, non-verifable, un-researched, silly, child like opinion and when spoken spreading it to others. 

Every single person has a different opinion, creativty 
	
What is the clearest difference between what is GOOD vs BAD. 

Something bad inflicts pain on another or yourself. 

What does it mean to inflict pain , is harming your body inflicting pain? In the physical, sure, but that was your will. 

Is causing harm to the body you own, BAD? 

body is a vessel, a transportation device, it is yours to use to your liking. 
An arm does not make you, you. 
A leg does not make you, you. 
A lung does not make you, you. 
A brain does not make you, you. 
No parts of the body make up GOD.

To say that there is pure evil is to say that there is pure light. Where is it. Even White is the combination of all colors. Black is the absence of color, that can always be filled.
