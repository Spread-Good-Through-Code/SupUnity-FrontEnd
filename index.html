<center><b><big>Mission Statement</big></b></center>
<b>Un-centralized Idea Support and Auditability with Blockchain Technology and Faith Token</b>
<br>
Trust should not come on a mantle. What should come first? Faith, believing. It should be noted that this idea comes from a strong belief in God and that spreading belief and Good things is overall better then not doing anything. 
<br>
<b>Key Overall Goal:</b> Spread and support Good ideas through blockchain technology. 
<br>
<b>Overview High Level: </b>
<br><br>
People should be incentivized and rewarded for doing and supporting Good things. Actors who commit and excute on doing Good things should be rewarded, tracked and promoted. 
Actors who commit but do not follow through with their promises should be held publicly accountable or easily distingueshed from Good actors. 
Blockchain and crypto technology provide an easy to use method accessible world wide that can be used to support anyone and anything that is Good. 
Through an auditable and easily verifiable trail, trusted and Good people and ideas will continue to rise and bad actors will either not participate or have a public ledger cleary defining their past commitments and follow through rate for their actions. 
<br><br>
Through the use of blockchain and a new token (tentaivly named "FAITH Token") to support good ideas, this can be counteracted by supporting and investing in good ideas (i.e. possible laws, new cancer research, etc) and allowing anyone who wishes to receive or get that Good invesment if they provide enough proof that they've accomplished said task. 
Once enough evidence is provided, users worldwide (or regionally) could vote to determine if indeed said actor has completed the task. Additonally, this could just be a token that is used as an investment vechile if others belive the overall faith in "Good" or Faith will increase in the future. 
<br><br>
<b>Technical High Level: </b>
<br>
GUNDUM in this context, refers to the technological requirements and infrastructure needed to achieve this goal. 
<br>
GUNDUM - 
Continues Development and Continues Integration are already key aspects of technology development, it should be crucial that the techonological aspects of this project also continue to develop as secuirty and design principals evolve. 
This process, which introduces ongoing automation and monitoring throughout the lifecycle of apps, from integration and testing phases to delivery and deployment
 - needs to be implemented in a blockchain like manner that supports the updating of all aspects of the technology stack that support GUNDUM. Technology practices through AGILE and GIT provide a standarized way to make changes based on bug reports, issues and or requested features. 
 The idea of peer-review and peer-approval for changes is already baked into most technology enthusiast. The highest danger comes from a malicious actor taking control of the system and making unwanted changes. 
 Security technology principals already bake in the idea that you should have ZERO trust in anyone and provide only the minimal privileges to all users to accomplish the required task. 
The challenge will be how to ensure with as close to 100% certainty (Anomolies will occur) that the users conducting changes to the technology stack are trusted and that the changes being conducted are safe and GOOD. 
The idea here is to leverage blockchain to vote on changes that will take place in GUNDUM, allowing the majority to decide how changes to the stack evolve in an uncentralized manner. 
<br>
<br>
  <br>
<b>Possible Concerns - </b>
<br>
<b>Why is this different than GoFundMe, Kickstarter, other peer to peer support channels? </b>
AUDITABILITY and CONTINUED TRACTABILITY. The idea being that it would be similar to a social network where the things you commit to continue to be tracked over time. Reputation is important in small and large communities, but funds will be withheld if key commits are not completed regardless and that will be visible for all but especially key for time sensitive ideas (i.e. law needs to pass withen x amount of time) 
<br><br>

<b>How will the process of creating the token, minting and allocating of the initial funds be completed? </b>
TBD. Needs to be in an uncentralized way, but there needs to be an initial controller. NEAR seems to have excellent options for decentralized DOAs and governence. 
<br><br>
<b>How does NEAR/ETH play into this? </b>
After review, NEAR seems to provide large amounts of tools and options that fulfill the requirements of this project, including low transaction fees, built on top of ETH, countless resourceses and support from developers, as well as many others already listed through the NEAR site. 
<br>
<br> 
Through this site, I've provided a very basic example of how this can look like. This is only an initial proof of concept page only for demostration purposes.

 <pre><code class="u-full-width"> <center>GOD is REAL</center>  
<br><b> Scientific Hypothesis: </b> If GOD is real, what is the best scientific explanation for him
 <br>
Possible Theories: 
 1. Quantam Physics 
 
In essence, the current theories around QP relate to being an unobersable, unmeasureable and "random" 
phenomena that cant fully be understood. Science has so far stated that it may be impossible to ever
 know the exact positions of atoms at the subatomic level, only a "probability" can be caluclated. 
 Strange phenomena has been oberserved and tested where light particles and atoms act as a particle and a wave 
 at the SAME time, when left unobserved.

 <pre><code class="u-full-width"> <center>Keeping Beings Captive is WRONG</center>  
<br><b> Scientific Hypothesis: </b> If given the choice, would beings choose to be in a ZOO? <br>
Possible Theories: 
 1. It is wrong because they have been reduced to not having choices.
  Given the option to be free, they would be free. 
  Being captive reduces their choices of spreading true , faith , love, fun and creativity., 
 
 2. Open ZOO, area where any animal has the choice to be helped by humans if injured, needs help, seeks by its own free will
 
 Next Steps: Ideas on how to free beings that are captive.

  <pre><code class="u-full-width"> <center>Anyone can improve themselves</center>
  <br><b> Scientific Hypothesis: </b>  If anyone wanted to improve themselves, what would they need to do?<br>
Possible Theories: 
 1. SPREAD TRUE; SPREAD FAITH , SPREAD LOVE , SPREAD FUN , SPREAD CREATIVITY 
    1.1 SPREAD TRUE/TRUTH , be real about yourself, reality, your limitations of your mind, body and spirit. Speak the truth, the truth is closest to GOOD. 
    1.2 SPREAD FAITH, be a beacon of hope for those around you, inspire, help. Have faith in others, that their intentions are TRUE, and GOOD - noone is judging you, besides the thoughts that plague your own mind. 
    1.3 SPREAD LOVE, love other beings as you do yourself. Find ways to love others , go out of your way, if even a little. LOVE takes EFFORT. 
    1.4 SPREAD FUN, life is to enjoy, sip on a beer, enjoy a nice walk, go to the beach, theres fun no matter where you are , you only need to think it. 
    1.5 SPREAD CREATIVITY. Everything around us man made took an idea, an iniaitive to create, use the best of your own abilities to create something. Enjoy the beauty in what others create. Dont be afraid to go outside the box, the box is small.
