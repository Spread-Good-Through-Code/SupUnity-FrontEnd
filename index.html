<br><b> Scientific Hypothesis: </b> If GOD is real, what is the best scientific explanation for him
 <br>
Possible Theories: 
 1. Quantam Physics 
 
In essence, the current theories around QP relate to being an unobersable, unmeasureable and "random" 
phenomena that cant fully be understood. Science has so far stated that it may be impossible to ever
 know the exact positions of atoms at the subatomic level, only a "probability" can be caluclated. 
 Strange phenomena has been oberserved and tested where light particles and atoms act as a particle and a wave 
 at the SAME time, when left unobserved.

 <pre><code class="u-full-width"> <center>Keeping Beings Captive is WRONG</center>  
<br><b> Scientific Hypothesis: </b> If given the choice, would beings choose to be in a ZOO? <br>
Possible Theories: 
 1. It is wrong because they have been reduced to not having choices.
  Given the option to be free, they would be free. 
  Being captive reduces their choices of spreading true , faith , love, fun and creativity., 
 
 2. Open ZOO, area where any animal has the choice to be helped by humans if injured, needs help, seeks by its own free will
 
 Next Steps: Ideas on how to free beings that are captive.

  <pre><code class="u-full-width"> <center>Anyone can improve themselves</center>
  <br><b> Scientific Hypothesis: </b>  If anyone wanted to improve themselves, what would they need to do?<br>
Possible Theories: 
 1. SPREAD TRUE; SPREAD FAITH , SPREAD LOVE , SPREAD FUN , SPREAD CREATIVITY 
    1.1 SPREAD TRUE/TRUTH , be real about yourself, reality, your limitations of your mind, body and spirit. Speak the truth, the truth is closest to GOOD. 
    1.2 SPREAD FAITH, be a beacon of hope for those around you, inspire, help. Have faith in others, that their intentions are TRUE, and GOOD - noone is judging you, besides the thoughts that plague your own mind. 
    1.3 SPREAD LOVE, love other beings as you do yourself. Find ways to love others , go out of your way, if even a little. LOVE takes EFFORT. 
    1.4 SPREAD FUN, life is to enjoy, sip on a beer, enjoy a nice walk, go to the beach, theres fun no matter where you are , you only need to think it. 
    1.5 SPREAD CREATIVITY. Everything around us man made took an idea, an iniaitive to create, use the best of your own abilities to create something. Enjoy the beauty in what others create. Dont be afraid to go outside the box, the box is small.
